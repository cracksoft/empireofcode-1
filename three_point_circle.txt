Three Point Circle

If we want to build new silos, then we need to make more formal and useful plots of land. Our topographer only marks a few points on the map and thinks that is good enough. It doesn't give us the coordinates which all our robots use, just a handwritten note. Paper notes! The nerve.

Through any three points that do not exist on the same line, there lies a unique circle. The points of this circle are represented in a string with the coordinates like so:

(x1,y1),(x2,y2),(x3,y3)

Where x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3 are digits.

You should find the circle for the three given points, such that the circle lies through these point and return the result as a string with the equation of the circle. In a Cartesian coordinate system (with an X and Y axis), the circle with central coordinates of (x0,y0) and radius of r can be described with the following equation:

(x-x0)^2+(y-y0)^2=r^2

Where x0, y0, r are decimal numbers rounded to two decimal points. Remove extraneous zeros and all decimal points, they are not necessary. For rounding, use the standard mathematical rules.

Input: Coordinates as a string.

Output: The equation of the circle as a string.

Example:

circle_equation("(2,2),(6,2),(2,6)") == "(x-4)^2+(y-4)^2=2.83^2"
circle_equation("(3,7),(6,9),(9,7)") == "(x-6)^2+(y-5.75)^2=3.25^2"

Precondition:

0 < radius < 10

All three given points do not lie on one line.

How it is used:

This equation, also known as Equation of the Circle, comes from the Pythagorean theorem when applied to any point on a circle: the radius is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whose other sides are of length x − a and y − b. Of course you can use this concept for you mathematics software, but we really just want to remind you about how awesome circles can be.
